This is a proof-of-concept implementation of an idea I had to pull of
inheritance without OO.  Basically just want to wipe that smug smile
off the OO folks.


NAME
    foundation - Inheritance without objects

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;

      sub fooble { 42 }

      package Bar;

      sub mooble { 23 }

      package FooBar;
      use foundation qw(Foo Bar);

      print fooble();       # prints 42
      print moodle();       # prints 23

DESCRIPTION
    Haven't drunk the OO Kool-Aid yet? Think object-oriented has something
    to do with Ayn Rand? Do you eat Java programmers for breakfast?

    If the answer to any of those is yes, than this is the module for you!
    `foundation' adds the power of inheritance without getting into a
    class-war!

    Simply `use foundation' and list which libraries symbols you wish to
    "inherit". It then sucks in all the symbols from those libraries into
    the current one.

BUGS
    Plenty, I'm sure. This is a quick proof-of-concept knock off.
